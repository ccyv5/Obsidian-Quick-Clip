# Icons for Obsidian Web Clipper

This folder should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple placeholder icons or design custom icons for the extension.

### Quick Placeholder Icons

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares:

1. Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Create a new image with the required dimensions
3. Fill with a solid color (e.g., purple #6c5ce7 to match the theme)
4. Add text "OWC" or an "O" symbol
5. Save as PNG with the appropriate filename

### Recommended Design

- Use Obsidian's purple theme color (#6c5ce7)
- Include a recognizable symbol (e.g., a clipboard with a note)
- Keep it simple and clear at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Temporary Solution

Until proper icons are created, the extension will use Chrome's default extension icon.
